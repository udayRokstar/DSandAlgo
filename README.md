Prime number:  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and the number itself. It cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

Key Characteristics of Prime Numbers:
A prime number is greater than 1.
A prime number has exactly two distinct divisors: 1 and the number itself.
A number that has more than two divisors is called a composite number.

Fibonacci Numbers
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1 (or sometimes, depending on convention, it starts with 1 and 1). Each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.

Fibonacci Sequence Definition:
The sequence starts as:
